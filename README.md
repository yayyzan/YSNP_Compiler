# You Shall Not Parse C Compiler 

The following repository showcases my C-Compiler to RISCV assembly project, built in C++, with Flex based lexer, YACC parser for grammar, and integrated semantic analysis.

The compiler was tested via RISCV emulator, and passed 80% of testcases, ranking 4th out of 74 compilers.
